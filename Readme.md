# Project Description

This project is a SQL database management system that handles multiple tables and performs various queries and operations on them. It involves four different tasks, each with its own set of tables and questions to solve. The tasks cover a range of scenarios, such as managing manufacturers and products, employees and departments, warehouses and boxes, and movies and movie theaters.
The project demonstrates how to create tables, insert data into them, and perform complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the data. It covers a wide range of query types, including selecting data based on conditions, calculating averages and sums, sorting data, joining tables, and performing updates and deletions.
By working on this project, you will gain practical experience in SQL database management and learn how to design tables, write efficient queries, and perform common operations on a relational database. It serves as a great opportunity to enhance your SQL skills and deepen your understanding of database management systems.
